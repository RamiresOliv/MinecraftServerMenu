<h1 align="center"> MinecraftServerMenu GetStarted </h1>

## How I *(Ramires)* get started?
**Very simple** \
I created a website using a tool from GitHub itself. <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> with her I set up my website from the beginning.

Then I was updating all my files for updating and more in the Menu

## How You get started?

Well if you're wanting to make a website, it's very simple you can start using the <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> tool and then you'll never worry about hosting again, you get a custom url like this: \
EXAMPLE: <a href="https://gabrielramires.github.io/MinecraftServerMenu">gabrielramires.github.io/MinecraftServerMenu</a>

plus you may be using <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com>vscode</a> to start improving your site with jekyll.

(in my case I didn't use <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com>vscode</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>)
